ctree -- Generic n-ary tree (with doubly linked child nodes) in C

rationale
---------
For storing hierarchial information providing (very!) fast
inserts, deletes and moves. Plan to use it later in creating and
manipulating todo lists

building
--------
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cp ../test .
$ ./demo

todo
----
  * custom memory pool management to allocate in chunks (fewer calls to malloc and free)
